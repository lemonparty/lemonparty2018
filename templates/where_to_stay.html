  <p class="text">
    Please reach out to us about where you should stay!
    Lake Breeze has rooms (it <em>is</em> a motel, after all), but it is not
    big enough for everyone. We’re hoping to squeeze a bunch of people on-site.
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    As far as other options go, there is a Christian music festival taking
    Duluth <em>by storm</em> the weekend of the wedding, so a bunch of hotels
    are booking up.
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    But we’ve reserved a handful of rooms at a couple of different hotels, and
    are happy to help navigate other options (e.g., some cabins near Lake
    Breeze, AirBnBs, etc). So
    <a href="{{ url_for('contact') }}">get in touch</a>
    and we can help you figure out the best place to stay!
