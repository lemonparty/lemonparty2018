    Please reach out to us about where you should stay!
    We’re hoping to squeeze a bunch of people on-site at Lake Breeze,
    but it is not big enough for everyone.
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    As far as other options go, there is a Christian music festival taking
    Duluth <em>by storm</em> that weekend, so a bunch of hotels are booking up.
    But we’ve reserved a handful of rooms at a couple of hotels, and are happy
    to help navigate other options too (cabins near Lake Breeze, AirBnBs, etc).
    So <a href="{{ url_for('contact') }}">get in touch</a>
    and we can help you figure out the best place to stay!
