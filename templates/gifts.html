  <p class="text">
    Spending your weekend with us in Duluth is more than gift enough! We are
    grateful that you’ve chosen to come hang out with us, and know that many of
    you are already spending a bundle traveling to Duluth. So, seriously, don’t
    feel like you need to get us anything!
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    But if you’d like to give us something, you can volunteer to help out with
    stuff at the wedding; we’d appreciate any assistance!
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    If you insist on giving a gift, we’ll update this page with more
    information soon.

    {#
    If you <em>insist</em> on giving a gift, you can make a donation to
    <a href="https://secure.aspca.org/donate/donate">ASPCA</a> or the
    <a href="https://action.aclu.org/donate-aclu">ACLU</a>; they are two
    organizations that we would love to see supported. If that doesn’t strike
    your fancy, we’ll put any cash gifts towards a couch that isn’t a futon,
    or maybe even a “honeymoon”.

    We’ve lived together in a pretty small apartment for over 7 years now, so
    we have pretty much all the sheets, towels, and kitchen gadgets that anyone
    could need. But if you insist on giving us a gift, you could contribute to
    our honeymoon fund!
