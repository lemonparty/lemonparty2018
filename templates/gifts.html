  <p class="text">
    Spending your weekend with us in Duluth is more than gift enough! We are
    grateful that you’ve chosen to come hang out with us, and know that many of
    you already spent a bundle traveling to Duluth. Case closed.
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    If you’d like to give us something, you can volunteer to help out with
    stuff at the wedding; we’d appreciate any assistance!
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    If you insist on giving a gift, you can make a donation to ASPCA or the
    ACLU. And if you really, really insist on getting us something, you can
    contribute to our honeymoon fund [here](gotta figure something out, if we do this).
