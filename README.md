## Static assets

The CSS is written using SASS, and the JS is written in es6. Both are managed
with webpack. Assuming you already have node and npm installed, run `npm install`

Then to start webpack watching and compiling the files, run `npm run watch`. To
compile the minified files for use in production, run `npm run build`.
